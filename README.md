### Hi! I'm Matt.  
I'm a developer from Australia who loves all aspects of software engineering - from the low level of transistors and assembly, to the high-level of front-end development; as well as everything in between. My favourite areas however are game development and programming language theory. You can read more about me on [my website](http://www.matty-o.xyz/).  

I like working with all languages and technologies, but my favourite languages would be C++, Rust, and C#. My favourite technologies to work with are game/graphics libraries - such as Vulkan, OpenGL, and SDL2.  

Other than programming, my hobbies include cricket, badminton, and running. I am always open to messages, and you can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LucidSigma) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/kmatt17/).
