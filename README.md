### Matthew Sch√§fer.

* I'm a developer from Australia who loves making 2D games, game engines, and programming languages.
* My favourite languages include `C++`, `Rust`, and `C#` (but all languages are awesome in their own ways).
* Outside of programming I enjoy cricket, cycling, and running.
* Pronouns: He (subjective), him (objective), his (genitive/possessive), his (possessive determiner), himself (reflexive).
